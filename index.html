        Hello my name is Ryan Pilon. I am born and raised in Washington State. Since a child I always have been interested in computers, mostly computer games but dwelled into the security aspect when i was little. My interests were set aside for a while and have returned in the last couple years. I enjoy many forms of physical activity; including outdoor physical activities such as swimming, hiking, biking, and my recent favorite: spilitting wood.  I have minimal education experiance, got my GED, and started doing some college. It was enjoyable to see my work progress in math and get quicker at solving equations while enrolled. I quickly decided to go into the physical jobs right off the bat and leave college. Been working physical jobs such as construction, most recently in the commerical electrician field. Did that for a while and realized that might not be worth destroying my body for 4 years to get to a well paying permenant position. 

        One of the goals I will share about is my goal to buy around an acre of land out in deep snohomish county. From there I will add the necassry amenaties to the land and then start building a house.
