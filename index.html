            <li>Hello my name is Ryan Pilon.</li>

            <li>I am born and raised in Washington State.</li>

            <li>Since a child I always have been interested in computers, mostly computer games but dwelled into the security aspect when i was little. My interests were set aside for a while and have returned in the last couple years.</li>

            <li>I enjoy many forms of physical activity; including outdoor physical activities such as swimming, hiking, biking, and my recent favorite: spilitting wood.</li>

            <li>I have minimal education experiance, got my GED, and started doing some college. It was enjoyable to see my work progress in math and get quicker at solving equations while enrolled. </li>
            <li>I quickly decided to go into the physical jobs right off the bat and leave college.</li>

            <li>I have been working physical jobs such as construction, most recently in the commerical electrician field. Did that for a while and realized that might not be worth destroying my body for 4 years to get to a well paying permenant position.</li>

            <li> One of the goals I will share about is my goal to buy around an acre of land out in deep snohomish county. From there I will add the necassry amenaties to the land and then start building a house.</li>
